This package provides the following modificaitons to the VenusOS GUI:
    move Settings and Notifications to the top of the list man page
    hides the Tiles Overview
    enhances the Mobile Overview
        all new layout and tile organization
        add Inverter Only mode
        shows voltages current and frequency for AC in and out
        shows current for DC loads
        shows solar voltage and current
        hides Pump switch if not enabled to make more space for tanks
            (this became standard in v2.70~9)
        tanks column scrolls if there are more tanks than space allows
    enhances the Tank Tile
        red indicates low/high fluid levels
        indicates NO RESPONSE if no signal received from tank
        tile shrinks if needed to show more tanks, then list scrolls
        display custom tank names (stock in v2.70~9)
        displays absolute fluid quantity (e.g., gallons) in addition to percentage
    adds tank information to the flow Overview
        4 tanks fit along the bottom of the page
        for more than 4 tanks, the list scrolls
    adds AC voltage, current, frequency and input current limit to flow Overview
    adds power guages to AC In, AC Out and Inverter tiles
    
each of these modifications can be selected individually at install time

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

The power guages require additional information during installation.
    The first three values can be taken from the spec sheet for your specific Multi/Quatro, etc.
    The inverter's peak power provides a maximum displayable value.
        Use the value at which the inverter will continue to run only for a short period of time.
            For some inverters, this value is double the continuous value,
                so you may wish to set this to a lower value in order to favor more space
                to display lower values.
    The inverter's maximum continuous power sets the overload threshold.
        The intent is to show the power at which the inverter will run forever
        at least if ambient temperature is within reason.
        This value should be set to the inverer's maximum output power spec at 25 C.        
    The inverter's caution level indicates a power level at which the user should start
            looking at system power in order to prevent an overload.
        Set this parameter to something like the maximum power spec at highest temperature.
    The maximum system power is the point at which the components down stream will overload.
        For example, this could be set to the power equivalent to the power distribution panel's
        ain breaker (e.g., 50 amps on a 120volt system would be 6000 watts).
        This parameter is optional. Setting it allows the AC output guage to show an overload
            at this value rather than the sum of input and inverter powers (power assist).
        If you do not want this limitation, set the value to 0.

Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/GuiMods-current /data/GuiMods

If not, do the following a computer that does have internet access

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/GuiMods-current

mv /data/GuiMods-current /data/GuiMods

then move the resulting .tar.gx file to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or click on this link in a web browser:

https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.

mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

Note, you must do GuiMods and SetupHelper on a separate flash drive since they use
the same file name on the flash drive. 

If you are installing multiple packages, SetupHelper need only be installed once.

Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/GuiMods/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
