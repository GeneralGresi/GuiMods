This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/GuiMods/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/GuiMods-current /data/GuiMods

If not, run the following commands on a computer that does have internet access

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/TankRepeater/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz GuiMods.tar.gz

then move the resulting .tar.gx file to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/TankRepeater/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz


Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/GuiMods/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
